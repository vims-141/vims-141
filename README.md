## 🧠 About Me  

I am an **MCA student at Pondicherry University** with a strong focus on  
**Cybersecurity, Networking, and Machine Learning**.

I work at the intersection of **threat detection, data analysis, and AI**, building systems that can  
identify attacks, analyze traffic, and protect digital infrastructure.

My work includes **phishing detection models, honeypots, packet sniffers, and security automation**.
